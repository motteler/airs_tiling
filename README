Overview
=========

airs_tiling is a package to rearrange AIRS L1c obs from a global
sequential format to a global tiling, in which each tile has all the
sequential obs that fall within its boundaries, organized in 16-day
sets.  It also includes functions to do mapped 16-day statistical
summaries.

Notes

netCDF notes
-------------
Starting from an existing netCDF file, you can dump the CDL format
spec, edit it extensively, add or delete variables, write an empty
netCDF file from the CDL spec, and write data to the netCDF file.
This is convenient for managing relatively complex formats.  Some
examples:

 - chirp initial netCDF file from a CDL spec
     ncgen -o airs_tile.nc airs_tile.cdl

 - CDL spec extrated from a netCDF file
      ncdump -h uw_sdr_test.nc > uw_sdr_test.cdl

 - initial netcdf file from a CDL spec
      ncgen -o ncgen_test.nc uw_sdr_test.cdl
