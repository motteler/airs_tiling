Overview
=========

airs_tiling is a package to rearrange AIRS L1c obs from a global
sequential format to a global tiling, in which each tile has all
the obs that fall within its boundaries, organized as 16-day sets.
It also includes an unbuffered tiling function (for very slow tests
of the buffering) and some functions to do tiled 16-day statistical
summaries, predecessors to the all-channel tiling.

Main Files
============

AIRS tiling
------------
  airsL1c2buf    - AIRS buffered tiling main function
  airs_tile_task - .m and .sh batch wrappers for airsL1c2buf
  uniform_bands  - uniform sampling for a polar orbiter
  tile_index     - tile indices from lat/lon lists
  tile_file      - name and path for tile files
  set2dlist      - 16-day set number to datenum list
  setspan        - two 16-day set numbers spanning a year

support and test
-----------------
  write_buf     - buffered write for tile files
  airs_glist    - clean up an AIRS L1c directory
  airs_flat     - flatten an AIRS granule into lists
  read_airs_h4  - read an AIRS HDF4 granule (from CHIRP repo)
  read_test*    - several tile file checks
  airsL1c2tile  - AIRS unbuffered tiling main function

tile compression
-----------------
  comp_tiles     - compress and test a 16-day tile set
  comp_tile_task - .m and .sh batch wrappers for comp_tiles

key data files
---------------
  latB64.mat     - equal sample latitude bands
  airs_tile.nc   - AIRS tile initial netCDF file
  airs_tile.cdl  - AIRS tile netCDF data spec

16-day stats
-------------
  airs_sdr2tab    - take AIRS SDRs to map tables
  airs_sdr2obs    - obs lists from AIRS L1c subsets
  airs_sdr_batch  - batch wrapper for airs_sdr2tab and airs_sdr2obs

Data Format
============

wnum, nedn, chan_qc, rad_qc, and synth_frac are all just fill
values, either NaNs or 9.9692e+36 for single and -1 for int8's,
depending on the reader.  (netCDF calls swap fill values for NaNs,
but return most variables as doubles.)  wnum and the other variables
are defined in the CDL spec but never set in the code.  I should
have filled in wnum, but most of the rest are either trivial or not
well-defined for the tiles.  For example rad_qc should always be 2
(OK) because I drop the obs where it is not.  NEdN and synth_frac
could be representative values or averages over values written to
the tile, but I didn't do that.  Since there was some rush to get
this going, as soon as the basic stuff looked OK, I just let it run.

Notes

netCDF notes
-------------
Starting from an existing netCDF file, you can dump the CDL format
spec, edit it extensively, add or delete variables, write an empty
netCDF file from the CDL spec, and write data to the netCDF file.
This is convenient for managing relatively complex formats.  Some
examples:

 - chirp initial netCDF file from a CDL spec
     ncgen -o airs_tile.nc airs_tile.cdl

 - CDL spec extrated from a netCDF file
      ncdump -h uw_sdr_test.nc > uw_sdr_test.cdl

 - initial netcdf file from a CDL spec
      ncgen -o ncgen_test.nc uw_sdr_test.cdl
